# FastAPI Metrics Monitoring System - Project Statement

## Project Overview

Build a comprehensive FastAPI application that implements both system-level and application-level metrics monitoring using Prometheus metrics format. The application will expose detailed performance metrics for monitoring infrastructure health and application behavior.

---

## Objectives

### Primary Goals

- Develop a production-ready FastAPI application with built-in metrics collection
- Implement system resource monitoring (CPU, memory usage)
- Track HTTP request patterns and performance metrics
- Provide real-time observability into application behavior
- Enable scalable monitoring architecture for production deployment

### Success Criteria

- All default system metrics are accurately collected and exposed
- HTTP request metrics provide comprehensive request lifecycle visibility
- Metrics endpoint returns properly formatted Prometheus metrics
- Application maintains performance under load while collecting metrics
- Documentation covers deployment and monitoring setup

---

## Technical Requirements

### System Metrics Implementation

- **CPU Metrics**
  - `process_cpu_seconds_total`: Total CPU time consumed by the process
  - CPU usage rate calculation: `rate(process_cpu_seconds_total[5m])`
  - CPU utilization percentage tracking

- **Memory Metrics**
  - `process_resident_memory_bytes`: Physical memory currently used
  - `process_virtual_memory_bytes`: Virtual memory allocated
  - Memory usage trends and alerting thresholds

- **Additional System Metrics**
  - Process start time and uptime
  - File descriptor usage
  - Garbage collection statistics
  - Thread count monitoring

### HTTP Application Metrics

- **Request Volume Metrics**
  - `http_requests_total`: Counter for total HTTP requests with labels:
    - `method`: HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
    - `endpoint`: Request path/route
    - `status_code`: HTTP response status
  - Global request rate: `rate(http_requests_total[5m])`
  - Per-endpoint request rates

- **Request Performance Metrics**
  - `http_request_duration_seconds`: Histogram of request durations
  - 95th percentile latency:
    ```prometheus
    histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{endpoint="/data",method="GET"}[5m])) by (le))
    ```
  - Request size and response size histograms

## Technical Stack

### Core Framework

- FastAPI: Main web framework
- Python 3.8+: Runtime environment
- Uvicorn: ASGI server for production deployment

### Monitoring Stack

- Prometheus Client: Metrics collection and exposition
- Prometheus: Metrics storage and querying (external)

### Additional Libraries

- `psutil`: System resource monitoring
- `middleware`: Custom FastAPI middleware for HTTP metrics
- `asyncio`: Asynchronous operations support

## Architecture Design

### Application Structure

The following structure is provided as a demo example. Teams can design their own structure based on their preferences and requirements:
```
fastapi-metrics-app/ 
├── app/ 
│ ├── main.py # FastAPI application entry point 
│ ├── metrics/ 
│ │ ├── init.py 
│ │ ├── system_metrics.py # CPU, memory metrics 
│ │ └── http_metrics.py # HTTP request metrics 
│ ├── middleware/ 
│ │ └── metrics_middleware.py 
│ ├── routers/ 
│ │ ├── api.py # Business logic endpoints 
│ │ └── health.py # Health check endpoints 
│ └── config.py # Configuration management 
├── requirements.txt 
└── README.md
```


> Note: This is a suggested structure for demonstration purposes. Feel free to organize the codebase according to your team’s conventions and project requirements.

### Key Components

- **Metrics Middleware**
  - Intercept all HTTP requests
  - Record request start time, method, path
  - Track response status and duration
  - Update Prometheus counters and histograms

- **System Metrics Collector**
  - Background task collecting system resources
  - Periodic updates of CPU and memory gauges
  - Process-level statistics monitoring

- **Metrics Endpoint**
  - `/metrics` endpoint exposing Prometheus format
  - Proper `Content-Type` headers

---

## Implementation Requirements

### Core Endpoints

- `GET /`: Root endpoint with basic response
- `GET /health`: Health check endpoint
- `GET /metrics`: Prometheus metrics exposition
- `POST /data`: Sample data processing endpoint
- `GET /data`: Sample data retrieval endpoint

### Metrics Configuration

- Configurable metric collection intervals
- Histogram bucket customization
- Label standardization across metrics
- Metric naming conventions following Prometheus best practices

---

## Documentation Deliverables

### Technical Documentation

- Metrics reference guide
- Deployment instructions using `docker-compose`
- Configuration options (if any)

> This project will result in a FastAPI application with comprehensive metrics monitoring capabilities.
